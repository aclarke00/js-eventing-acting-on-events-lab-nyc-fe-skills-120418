// EVENT LISTENER

// 1 - find the thing to do the event continue
// we actually don't need an element (the document will get the event listener)

// 2 - write the function that will happen when we do the thing

const moveDodgerLeft = () => {
  // get dodger first
  const dodger = document.getElementById('dodger')
  // next thing is changing layout / position of dodger, meaning we need css changes
